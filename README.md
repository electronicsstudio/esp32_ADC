# esp32_ADC

Hi, In this repository we will see the step by step of our code and its operation, the function of this program 
is to be able, with a potentiometer, to vary the intensity of the current that is supplied,
in this case the conversions of ADC to Voltage to DAC for full operation.

**ESP32 Basics: Analog-to-digital Converter (ADC)**

Potentiometer is connected to GPIO 34 (Analog ADC1_CH6) 
voltage levels between 0 V and 3.3V
The voltage measured is then assigned to a value between 0 and 4095, in which 0 V corresponds to 0, and 3.3 V corresponds to 4095.
